> *"Vibe coding allows people to be software architects instead of engineers. I've seen engineers use this and act more as software architects and let the AI write all the code. I've also seen it be very effective for non-developers to be able to actually build the ideas that they've never been able to do before without hiring a programmer. In my opinion, it's going to lead to a huge shift in how programming happens and enable more people than ever to build software."*

> *"The future of coding isn't about typing lines of syntax—it's about orchestrating ideas, shaping logic with intuition, and letting AI handle the grunt work. Vibe coding isn't just a method; it's a mindset—where creativity, collaboration, and flow replace rigid rules. The best coders of tomorrow won't just write code; they'll design experiences, automate solutions, and let the vibes guide the machine to create the next generation of software in minutes not months."*
