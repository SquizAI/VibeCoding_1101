# Exercise 1: Crafting Your First Effective Prompt

## Objective
Learn how to write clear, effective prompts that generate the code you need.

## Instructions

1. Choose one of the following simple projects:
   - A personal introduction webpage
   - A temperature converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit)
   - A random password generator

2. Before using any AI tool, write down:
   - What the program should do (functionality)
   - Any specific features you want to include
   - The preferred programming language
   - Any styling preferences (if applicable)

3. Craft a prompt that includes:
   - A clear description of what you want to build
   - Specific requirements or constraints
   - The target programming language/framework
   - Any preferences for code style or organization

4. Use your prompt with an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

5. Evaluate the result:
   - Did the AI understand your requirements?
   - What aspects of the generated code match what you wanted?
   - What's missing or different from what you expected?

6. Revise your prompt to address any gaps or misunderstandings, and try again.

7. Compare the results from your original and revised prompts.

## Example Prompt Template

```
I need help creating [type of application] that [main purpose/functionality].

Requirements:
- It should [specific function 1]
- It should [specific function 2]
- It should [specific function 3]

Technical details:
- Programming language: [language]
- Framework/libraries: [if applicable]
- Code style: [any specific preferences]

Additional notes:
- [Any other information that might be helpful]
```

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, consider these questions:

1. Which elements of your prompt were most effective at getting what you wanted?
2. What specific changes in your revised prompt led to better results?
3. Were there any unexpected interpretations by the AI? Why might they have occurred?
4. How would you structure prompts differently for more complex projects?
