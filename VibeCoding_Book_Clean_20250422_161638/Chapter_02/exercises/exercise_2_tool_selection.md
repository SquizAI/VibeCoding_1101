# Exercise 2: Choosing the Right AI Tools

## Objective
Learn how to evaluate and select the most appropriate AI tools for different coding tasks.

## Instructions

1. For each of the following scenarios, identify which AI tool(s) would be most appropriate and why:

   a. **Scenario 1**: You need to quickly prototype a web application with a login system, dashboard, and data visualization components.
   
   b. **Scenario 2**: You're learning JavaScript and need help understanding how asynchronous functions work with practical examples.
   
   c. **Scenario 3**: You have an existing Python application and need to refactor it to improve performance.
   
   d. **Scenario 4**: You need to generate unit tests for a complex class that handles payment processing.
   
   e. **Scenario 5**: You want to build a mobile app that works on both iOS and Android platforms.

2. For each scenario, provide:
   - The AI tool(s) you would choose
   - Specific features of the tool that make it suitable for this scenario
   - How you would approach working with the tool for this task
   - Any limitations you might encounter and how to address them

3. Try using at least two different AI tools for one of the scenarios and compare the results.

## Tool Comparison Template

Strengths for this scenario:
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]
Limitations for this scenario:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]
Approach:
[How you would use this tool for the task]

Tool 2: [Name]
Strengths for this scenario:
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]
Limitations for this scenario:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]
Approach:
[How you would use this tool for the task]

Comparison:
[Which tool would you choose and why]
```

## Reflection Questions

1. What criteria are most important when selecting an AI tool for a coding task?
2. How do different AI tools complement each other in a development workflow?
3. What are the trade-offs between using specialized AI tools versus general-purpose ones?
4. How might your tool selection change based on your level of expertise in the relevant programming languages?
