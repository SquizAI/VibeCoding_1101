# Effective Prompt Templates for Vibe Coding

This document provides reusable prompt templates for common Vibe Coding tasks, organized by complexity level and purpose.

## Basic Prompt Templates

### Project Initialization

```
Create a [type of project] using [language/framework]. The project should [main functionality].

Requirements:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

Please include:
- Project structure
- All necessary files
- Setup instructions
```

### Code Explanation

```
Explain the following code in simple terms:

```[language]
[paste code here]
```

Please include:
- What each section does
- Any important concepts used
- Potential improvements
```

### Bug Fixing

```
The following code has a bug:

```[language]
[paste code here]
```

Error message:
[paste error message]

Expected behavior:
[describe what should happen]

Actual behavior:
[describe what is actually happening]

Please help identify and fix the issue.
```

## Intermediate Prompt Templates

### Feature Implementation

```
I'm working on a [type of project] using [language/framework]. I need to implement [feature description].

Current code:
```[language]
[paste relevant code]
```

Requirements for the new feature:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

Technical constraints:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

Please provide a complete implementation of this feature that:
- Follows best practices
- Includes error handling
- Is well-documented
```

### Code Refactoring

```
Please refactor the following code to improve [performance/readability/maintainability]:

```[language]
[paste code here]
```

Specific concerns:
- [Concern 1]
- [Concern 2]

Please maintain all existing functionality while:
- [Improvement goal 1]
- [Improvement goal 2]
```

## Advanced Prompt Templates

### Architecture Design

```
I need to design a [type of system] that handles [requirements].

Technical requirements:
- Expected traffic: [volume]
- Data storage needs: [description]
- Integration points: [list]
- Security considerations: [requirements]
- Scalability needs: [description]

Please provide:
1. A high-level architecture diagram (in text)
2. Component descriptions
3. Data flow explanation
4. Technology recommendations
5. Potential challenges and solutions
```

### Performance Optimization

```
My [application/function/database] is experiencing performance issues when [condition].

Current metrics:
- [Metric 1]: [value]
- [Metric 2]: [value]

System specifications:
- [Hardware/Cloud resources]
- [Current configuration]

Relevant code:
```[language]
[paste code here]
```

Please analyze potential bottlenecks and provide specific optimization recommendations with:
1. Immediate actions to improve performance
2. Medium-term architectural changes
3. Monitoring suggestions to track improvements
```

### AI Collaboration Pattern

```
I'm working on [project description] and want to establish an effective collaboration pattern with you.

Project context:
- [Key information about the project]
- [Current progress]
- [Goals]

For this collaboration, I'd like to:
1. [Expectation 1]
2. [Expectation 2]
3. [Expectation 3]

My preferred working style is:
- [Preferences for interaction]
- [Level of detail needed]
- [How decisions should be made]

Let's establish:
- Communication framework
- Progress tracking method
- Regular review process
```
