# Exercise 1: Your First AI-Assisted Coding Project (Beginner Level)

## Overview

This exercise introduces you to the basics of AI-assisted coding by guiding you through the creation of a simple web application using AI tools. You'll learn how to leverage AI to help you write code, understand concepts, and solve problems more efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

- Experience using AI coding assistants to generate code from descriptions
- Understand the differences between traditional and AI-assisted development
- Develop confidence in communicating programming intent to AI tools
- Learn to evaluate and refine AI-generated code

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (free)
- Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript concepts
- Access to ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or another AI coding assistant

## The Challenge

Create a simple web-based to-do list application using AI assistance. The application should allow users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The goal is to write as little code manually as possible while still understanding what the AI is generating for you.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

1. Create a new directory for your project called `vibe-todo-app`
2. Ask an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) to help you set up the basic file structure for a simple web application
3. Based on the AI's suggestions, create these files in your directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`

## Step 2: Design the User Interface

1. Prompt the AI with: "Generate HTML and CSS for a clean, modern to-do list application with input field, add button, and space for the task list"
2. Review the AI's suggestions and implement them in your HTML and CSS files
3. If you want changes to the design, refine your prompt with specific details
4. Test the interface by opening the HTML file in a browser

## Step 3: Implement the Functionality

1. Prompt the AI with: "Write JavaScript code to implement these features for my to-do list app:
   - Add new tasks when the user clicks the Add button or presses Enter
   - Display tasks with a checkbox and delete button
   - Allow marking tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox
   - Delete tasks when clicking the delete button
   - Store tasks in localStorage so they persist between page refreshes"
2. Review the code provided by the AI
3. Ask the AI to explain any parts of the code you don't understand
4. Implement the code in your `script.js` file

## Step 4: Test and Refine

1. Test your application thoroughly
2. If you encounter bugs or want to add features, prompt the AI with specific questions
3. For example: "The delete button isn't working correctly. Here's my current code: [paste your code]. What might be wrong?"
4. Implement the suggested fixes and continue testing

## Deliverables

- A working to-do list web application
- A brief reflection (200-300 words) on your experience using AI assistance, including:
  - How did the AI help you solve problems?
  - What challenges did you encounter when working with the AI?
  - How does this approach differ from traditional coding?

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: Does the application work as expected?
- Understanding: Can you explain how the code works?
- AI Utilization: Did you effectively leverage AI assistance?
- Reflection: Does your reflection demonstrate thoughtful analysis of the AI-assisted development process?

## Bonus Challenges

- Add categories or tags for tasks
- Implement a dark/light mode toggle
- Add due dates to tasks with sorting options
- Ask the AI to help you make the app responsive for mobile devices
