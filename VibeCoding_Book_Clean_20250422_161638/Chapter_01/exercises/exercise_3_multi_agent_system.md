# Exercise 3: Building a Multi-Agent AI Development System (Ninja Level)

## Overview

This ninja-level exercise challenges you to build a sophisticated multi-agent AI development system that can self-improve and handle complex software engineering tasks with minimal human supervision. You'll design an orchestration layer that coordinates multiple specialized AI models to tackle different aspects of the software development process.

## Learning Objectives

- Master advanced prompt engineering techniques for complex multi-step reasoning
- Design systems that coordinate multiple AI models with specialized capabilities
- Implement self-improvement mechanisms in AI-assisted development workflows
- Develop strategies for formal verification and validation of AI-generated code
- Create architectures that combine human expertise with AI capabilities optimally

## Prerequisites

- Advanced programming skills and system design experience
- Understanding of LLM architectures and their capabilities/limitations
- Experience with tool-augmented AI agents
- Knowledge of software verification techniques
- Familiarity with orchestration systems

## The Challenge

Design and implement a multi-agent AI development system capable of building and maintaining a complex web application. Your system should include specialized agents for:

1. Requirements analysis and architecture design
2. Frontend development
3. Backend API development
4. Database design and optimization
5. Testing and quality assurance
6. Security analysis
7. Documentation generation
8. Code review and improvement

The system should orchestrate these agents, provide a way to resolve conflicts between their outputs, and include self-improvement mechanisms.

## Step 1: Define the Agent Architecture

1. Design a formal specification for each specialized agent, including:
   - Input/output schemas
   - Contextual knowledge requirements
   - Evaluation metrics
   - Failure modes and recovery strategies

2. Implement a coordination protocol for inter-agent communication:
   ```
   agent_1_output → validator → transformation → agent_2_input
   ```

3. Design the orchestration layer that will sequence agent activities and resolve conflicts

## Step 2: Implement the Core Framework

1. Create the agent abstraction layer that standardizes interaction with different AI models and tools
   ```python
   class Agent:
       def process(self, task: Task, context: Context) -> Result:
           pass
       
       def evaluate(self, result: Result) -> EvaluationMetrics:
           pass
       
       def improve(self, feedback: Feedback) -> None:
           pass
   ```

2. Implement the task planning system that decomposes complex development goals into agent-specific tasks

3. Build the context management system that maintains state across multiple agent interactions

4. Create validation mechanisms to ensure the correctness of agent outputs before they're passed to subsequent agents

## Step 3: Implement the Specialized Agents

1. For each specialized agent, design optimal prompting strategies using techniques like:
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Tree-of-thoughts exploration
   - Few-shot learning with curated examples
   - Recursive decomposition of complex tasks

2. Implement the agents using the framework from Step 2

3. Create agent-specific validation rules and fallback mechanisms

## Step 4: Self-Improvement System

1. Design a feedback collection mechanism that logs successes, failures, and human interventions

2. Implement a prompt optimization system that can refine agent prompts based on historical performance

3. Create a knowledge distillation system that extracts patterns from successful interactions to improve future performance

## Step 5: Demonstration Project

1. Define a complex web application with multiple components (e.g., a project management system with real-time collaboration)

2. Use your multi-agent system to build the application with minimal human intervention

3. Document all instances where human guidance was required and how the system could be improved to eliminate these interventions
