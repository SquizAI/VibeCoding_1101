## Overview

In this advanced exercise, you'll implement a RESTful API using modern backend technologies with AI assistance. You'll learn effective prompt engineering techniques to generate sophisticated code that follows best practices while maintaining control over the architecture and design decisions.

## Learning Objectives

- Master prompt engineering for complex software development tasks
- Learn to effectively decompose programming problems for optimal AI assistance
- Develop strategies for integrating AI-generated code into professional workflows
- Practice evaluating and optimizing AI-generated code for production use

## Prerequisites

- Experience with backend development (JavaScript/Node.js, Python, or similar)
- Understanding of RESTful API design principles
- Familiarity with database concepts (SQL or NoSQL)
- Access to an AI coding assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude)

## The Challenge

Design and implement a RESTful API for a content management system with the following features:
- User authentication (signup, login, password reset)
- Content CRUD operations with different permission levels
- Filtering, sorting, and pagination of content
- Data validation and error handling
- Basic analytics tracking (e.g., content views, user activity)

The goal is to minimize manual coding while maintaining high-quality architecture and implementation by effectively leveraging AI assistance.

## Step 1: System Design with AI Collaboration

1. Engage with your AI assistant to design the system architecture. Start with a prompt like: "I need to design a content management API with the following features: [list the requirements]. Help me design a clean architecture with separation of concerns."
2. Iterate on the AI's suggestions, asking for clarification or alternatives where needed.
3. Document the final architecture, including:
   - Entity Relationship Diagram
   - API endpoints and their specifications
   - Authentication flow
   - Component diagram showing separation of concerns

## Step 2: Scaffold the Project with Effective Prompts

1. Based on your architecture, prompt the AI to generate a project scaffold. For example: "Generate a Node.js/Express project structure for the CMS API we designed, using the repository pattern, with TypeScript and MongoDB."
2. For each major component (auth, content management, analytics), craft specific prompts that focus on interfaces and contracts first. For example: "Create the TypeScript interfaces and service contracts for the authentication module."
3. Review code quality and request improvements where necessary: "The authentication service looks good, but could you add proper error handling and implement rate limiting?"

## Step 3: Testing Strategy with AI Assistance

1. Prompt the AI to help develop a comprehensive testing strategy: "Help me develop a testing strategy for this API, including unit tests, integration tests, and API tests."
2. Use AI to generate test cases for critical paths: "Generate unit tests for the authentication service, focusing on edge cases like expired tokens and invalid credentials."
3. Implement the tests, using AI to help with complex test scenarios.

## Step 4: Security Audit and Optimization

1. Ask the AI to review your implementation for security vulnerabilities: "Review this authentication code for potential security issues and suggest improvements."
2. Use AI to optimize performance: "This endpoint is fetching too much data. How can I implement pagination and query optimization?"
3. Implement the suggested improvements, iterating with the AI to refine solutions.

## Deliverables

- A fully functional RESTful API with authentication and content management
- Comprehensive test suite with good coverage
- API documentation (can be generated with AI assistance)
- A technical report (800-1000 words) analyzing:
  - Your prompt engineering approach and lessons learned
  - Comparison of code quality between AI-generated and what you would have written manually
  - Security and performance considerations in AI-assisted development
  - Workflow optimizations discovered during the exercise

## Evaluation Criteria

- Architecture quality: Clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability
- Code quality: Follows best practices, handles edge cases, includes proper error handling
- Security: Implements authentication correctly, prevents common vulnerabilities
- Testing: Comprehensive test coverage of critical paths and edge cases
- Analysis: Thoughtful reflection on the AI-assisted development process

## Bonus Challenges

- Implement API versioning and backward compatibility
- Add real-time notifications using WebSockets
- Containerize the application with Docker using AI assistance
- Create an admin dashboard UI using AI-assisted frontend development
- Implement rate limiting and advanced security features
