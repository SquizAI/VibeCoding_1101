## 🔷 Effective Prompting Patterns

### 🔹 The Persona Pattern

```
Act as an experienced JavaScript developer with 10+ years of experience in React.
Review this component and suggest performance optimizations:

```

### 🔹 The Step-by-Step Pattern

```
Please help me build a REST API in Express.js by:
1. Creating the basic server setup
2. Adding the necessary middleware
3. Creating routes for CRUD operations
4. Implementing database connections
5. Adding error handling
```

### 🔹 The Constraint Pattern

```
Generate a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key.
The solution must:
- Have O(n log n) time complexity
- Include error handling
- Be well-documented with comments
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
```

### 🔹 The Example-Driven Pattern

```
I want to create a function that formats phone numbers.
Examples:
Input: "1234567890" → Output: "(123) 456-7890"
Input: "123-456-7890" → Output: "(123) 456-7890"
Input: "(123)456-7890" → Output: "(123) 456-7890"
```
