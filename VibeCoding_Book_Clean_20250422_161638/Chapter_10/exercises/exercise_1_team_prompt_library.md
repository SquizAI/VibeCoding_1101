# Exercise 1: Building a Team Prompt Library

## Overview

In this exercise, you will create a collaborative prompt library for your development team. A well-designed prompt library helps standardize AI interactions, share effective prompting techniques, and build a foundation for consistent AI-augmented workflows across your team.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of standardized prompts for team collaboration
- Develop a framework for organizing and categorizing prompts
- Create reusable prompt templates for common development tasks
- Implement a system for evaluating and improving prompts over time
- Establish a process for sharing prompt knowledge across team members

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of prompt engineering (from earlier chapters)
- Experience with at least one AI coding assistant (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT)
- Access to a shared repository for team documentation
- 2+ team members to collaborate with (or you can simulate a team environment)

## Exercise

### Part 1: Design Your Prompt Library Structure

1. **Create a Repository Structure**:

Create a shared repository or documentation space with the following structure:

```
/team-prompt-library
|-- README.md
|-- /prompt-templates
|   |-- /code-generation
|   |-- /refactoring
|   |-- /testing
|   |-- /documentation
|   |-- /debugging
|   |-- /review
|-- /prompt-guidelines
|-- /examples
|-- /evaluation
```

2. **Develop Prompt Categories**:

For each category in your library, define:
- Purpose of prompts in this category
- When to use these prompts
- Key elements to include
- Common pitfalls to avoid

Example category definition for the README.md:

```markdown
## Code Generation Prompts

**Purpose**: Prompts designed to generate new code components with consistent style and documentation.

**When to Use**: 
- Creating new functions, classes, or modules
- Implementing standard patterns or interfaces
- Generating boilerplate code

**Key Elements to Include**:
- Component purpose and requirements
- Input/output specifications
- Error handling expectations
- Performance considerations
- Coding style guidelines

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Insufficiently specific requirements leading to generic code
- Missing context about related components
- Unclear error handling requirements
```

### Part 2: Create Core Prompt Templates

Develop at least one high-quality template for each of these essential categories:

1. **Code Generation Template**:

```markdown
# Code Generation: [Component Type]

## Requirements
- **Purpose**: [Describe what this code should do]
- **Inputs**: [Describe inputs with types and formats]
- **Outputs**: [Describe expected outputs with types and formats]
- **Error Handling**: [Specify error cases and how to handle them]
- **Performance Considerations**: [Any specific performance requirements]

## Technical Context
- **Language/Framework**: [Specify language and framework]
- **Related Components**: [List related code this will interact with]
- **Coding Standards**: [Reference team standards to follow]

## Additional Notes
- [Any other specific requirements or constraints]

Generate [language] code for a [component type] that fulfills these requirements.
```

2. **Code Review Template**:

```markdown
# Code Review

## Code to Review
```
[Paste code here]
```

## Review Context
- **Purpose**: [What this code is intended to do]
- **Key Requirements**: [Essential requirements this code must meet]
- **Focus Areas**: [Specific aspects to focus review on]
  - [e.g., Security, Performance, Maintainability, etc.]

## Review Requests
Please provide a thorough review with:
1. Potential issues categorized by severity (critical, important, minor)
2. Specific recommendations for improvements
3. Any security or performance concerns
4. Positive aspects worth highlighting
5. Suggestions for better code organization or patterns
```

3. **Debugging Template**:

```markdown
# Debugging Assistance

## Problem Description
- **Expected Behavior**: [What should happen]
- **Actual Behavior**: [What is happening instead]
- **Error Messages**: [Any error messages or logs]

## Code with Issue
```
[Paste problematic code here]
```

## Context
- **Environment**: [Relevant details about execution environment]
- **Reproduction Steps**: [How to reproduce the issue]
- **What I've Tried**: [Debugging steps already attempted]

## Request
Please help me:
1. Identify potential causes of this issue
2. Suggest specific debugging approaches
3. Provide possible solutions
```

4. **Documentation Template**:

```markdown
# Documentation Generation

## Code to Document
```
[Paste code here]
```

## Documentation Needs
- **Target Audience**: [Who will read this documentation]
- **Documentation Type**: [API docs, Technical guide, Tutorial, etc.]
- **Detail Level**: [Beginner-friendly, Technical depth, etc.]
- **Special Focus**: [Areas that need special attention]

## Request
Please generate comprehensive documentation that includes:
1. Overview of purpose and functionality
2. Detailed description of parameters/properties
3. Example usage scenarios with code
4. Common pitfalls or important notes
5. Related components or functions
```

### Part 3: Implement Prompt Evaluation System

Create a structured approach to evaluate and improve prompts:

1. **Design an Evaluation Form**:

```markdown
# Prompt Evaluation Form

## Prompt Details
- **Name**: [Prompt name]
- **Category**: [Prompt category]
- **Purpose**: [Brief description of purpose]
- **Usage Count**: [How many times used]

## Effectiveness Metrics
- **Accuracy**: [1-5 rating] - How accurate was the AI's output?
- **Completeness**: [1-5 rating] - How complete was the response?
- **Context Understanding**: [1-5 rating] - Did the AI understand the context?
- **Efficiency**: [1-5 rating] - How much editing was required afterward?

## Qualitative Feedback
- **Strengths**: [What worked well]
- **Weaknesses**: [What didn't work well]
- **Improvement Ideas**: [Suggestions for improving the prompt]

## Version History
- **Current Version**: [Version number]
- **Last Updated**: [Date]
- **Change Log**: [Brief description of changes in each version]
```

2. **Establish Evaluation Process**:

Document a process for team prompt evaluation:

```markdown
# Prompt Evaluation Process

1. **Initial Creation**:
   - Author creates prompt template
   - Author tests with at least 3 different scenarios
   - Author documents results in evaluation form

2. **Peer Review**:
   - At least one team member reviews the prompt
   - Reviewer tests with 2 different scenarios
   - Reviewer adds feedback to evaluation form

3. **Team Adoption**:
   - Present prompt at team meeting
   - Add to prompt library with "Experimental" tag
   - Team members use and provide feedback

4. **Refinement**:
   - After 5+ uses, review collective feedback
   - Make improvements based on patterns
   - Update version and documentation

5. **Standardization**:
   - After proven effectiveness, promote to "Standard" status
   - Include in onboarding materials
   - Schedule periodic reviews (quarterly)
```

### Part 4: Collaborative Improvement Exercise

Work with your team to iteratively improve prompts:

1. Have each team member select one prompt template to use for a real task
2. Document results using the evaluation form
3. Meet to discuss findings and suggest improvements
4. Create version 2 of each prompt based on feedback
5. Test improved prompts and compare results

### Part 5: Document Best Practices

Based on your team's experience, create a "Prompt Engineering Best Practices" guide that includes:

1. **Team-Specific Guidelines**:
   - Conventions for prompt structure
   - Required context elements for your codebase
   - Naming conventions for prompt templates
   - When to create new prompts vs. adapt existing ones

2. **Effectiveness Patterns**:
   - Patterns observed in your most effective prompts
   - Common failure patterns to avoid
   - Strategies for providing sufficient context
   - Techniques for getting more consistent results

3. **Integration Workflow**:
   - How prompts integrate with your development workflow
   - Process for versioning and updating prompts
   - Methods for sharing AI interaction insights

## Deliverables
