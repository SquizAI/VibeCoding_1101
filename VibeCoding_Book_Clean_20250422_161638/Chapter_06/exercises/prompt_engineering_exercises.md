## ðŸŒ± Beginner Exercises

### Exercise B1: Basic Prompt Refinement

**Objective:** Transform vague prompts into specific, actionable requests.

**Instructions:**
1. Start with the following vague prompts:

Refined: "Create a responsive login form using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with the following features:
- Email and password fields with validation
- 'Remember me' checkbox functionality
- Form submission handling with visual feedback
- Simple error messaging for failed validation

The form should match our existing style guide which uses blue (#3498db) for primary buttons and light gray (#f4f6f8) for the background."
```

3. Test your prompts and refine them based on the responses

### Exercise B3: Instruction Clarity Challenge

**Objective:** Practice writing step-by-step instructions with clear expectations.

**Instructions:**
1. Write prompts requesting the AI to complete these tasks:
   - Create a function to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit
   - Implement a simple todo list with local storage persistence
   - Write a script to validate email addresses using regular expressions

2. Structure each prompt with:
   - Numbered steps or clear sections
   - Specific requirements for each component
   - Expected input/output examples
   - Code style preferences

3. Review the AI's output against your instructions. Did it follow all your specifications?
4. Revise your prompts to address any misinterpretations

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Exercises

   - Building a serverless API with authentication and database integration

2. Write a comprehensive prompt using each element of the RECIPE framework:
   - **R**ole and Context
   - **E**xpertise Level
   - **C**onstraints and Requirements
   - **I**nput/Output Examples
   - **P**revious Code and Patterns
   - **E**valuation Criteria

3. Share your prompt with a peer or mentor for feedback
4. Test the prompt with an AI assistant and evaluate the completeness of the response

### Exercise A2: Comparative Implementation Analysis

**Objective:** Practice requesting and analyzing alternative implementation approaches.

**Instructions:**
1. Select a feature that could be implemented multiple ways:
   - State management in a frontend application
   - API authentication strategy
   - Database schema design for a specific use case
   - Asynchronous data processing pattern

2. Write a prompt requesting at least three different implementation approaches with:
   - Detailed code examples for each approach
   - Analysis of pros and cons
   - Performance implications
   - Maintenance considerations
   - Appropriate use cases for each approach

3. After receiving the response, write a follow-up prompt asking for a deeper comparison of the two most suitable options for your specific context
4. Document what you learned about the different approaches

### Exercise A3: Blueprint-First Development Practice

**Objective:** Use prompts to create comprehensive system blueprints before implementation.

**Instructions:**
1. Choose a system to design:
   - E-commerce inventory management system
   - Content management system with user roles
   - Event scheduling application with notifications

2. Create a multi-stage prompt sequence:
   - Stage 1: Request a high-level architecture blueprint
   - Stage 2: Ask for detailed component specifications based on the architecture
   - Stage 3: Request API contract design for key interfaces
   - Stage 4: Ask for implementation of a critical component

3. For each stage, craft a prompt that builds on the previous responses
4. Evaluate how well the final implementation aligns with the initial blueprint

## âš¡ Ninja Exercises

### Exercise N1: Meta-Prompt Construction

**Objective:** Create a prompt that generates specialized prompts for specific development tasks.

**Instructions:**
1. Design a meta-prompt that generates task-specific prompts for:
   - Frontend component development
   - API endpoint implementation
   - Database query optimization
   - Unit test creation

2. Your meta-prompt should:
   - Elicit the necessary context about the task
   - Generate a properly structured prompt template
   - Include guidance on evaluating the results
   - Suggest follow-up prompts for refinement

3. Test your meta-prompt by using it to generate at least three different task-specific prompts
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the generated prompts

### Exercise N2: Adversarial Prompt Engineering

**Objective:** Develop adversarial prompts to identify edge cases and potential issues in implementations.

**Instructions:**
1. Select an implementation domain:
   - Authentication and authorization systems

     - Identify potential security vulnerabilities
     - Discover edge cases not handled in the implementation
     - Find performance bottlenecks
     - Expose logical flaws in the design

3. Revise the implementation based on the adversarial prompt's findings
