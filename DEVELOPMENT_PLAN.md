# Vibe Coding 101: Development Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the development plan for "Vibe Coding 101," an introductory software development textbook focused on teaching the principles, practices, and applications of Vibe Coding - a new programming paradigm leveraging AI assistance.

## Book Structure

### Target Audience
The book will cater to three distinct skill levels:
1. **Beginner** - Those new to programming or AI-assisted development
2. **Advanced** - Experienced developers transitioning to Vibe Coding
3. **Ninja** - Masters looking to optimize and push the boundaries of AI collaboration

### Chapter Organization
Each chapter will be organized into its own folder with the following structure:
```
/Chapter_XX_Title/
  - Chapter_XX_Main.md         # Main content
  - Chapter_XX_Beginner.md     # Beginner-level content
  - Chapter_XX_Advanced.md     # Advanced-level content  
  - Chapter_XX_Ninja.md        # Ninja-level content
  - /exercises/                # Practice exercises
  - /examples/                 # Code examples
  - /images/                   # Visual assets
  - /resources/                # Additional resources
```

### Delivery Formats
The content will be prepared for three formats:
1. Digital book (e-reader friendly)
2. Printed textbook
3. Interactive website
