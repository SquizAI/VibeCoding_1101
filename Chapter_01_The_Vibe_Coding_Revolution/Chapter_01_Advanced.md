## Implementing Unified Agentic Systems in Production

The 2025 approach to production-ready Vibe Coding implementations leverages standardized patterns for robust, maintainable systems:

### Core Implementation Patterns

```typescript
// Unified Agentic System - Function Calling Pattern (TypeScript)

// 1. Define function schemas using standard JSON Schema format
const functionSchemas = {
  fetchUserData: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      userId: { type: "string", description: "Unique identifier for user" },
      includeMetadata: { type: "boolean", description: "Whether to include additional metadata" }
    },
    required: ["userId"]
  },
  // Additional function schemas...
};

// 2. Implement the actual functions that will be called
const toolImplementations = {
  fetchUserData: async ({ userId, includeMetadata = false }) => {
    // Actual implementation to fetch user data
    const userData = await database.users.findById(userId);
    return includeMetadata ? { ...userData, _metadata: { /* ... */ } } : userData;
  },
  // Additional function implementations...
};

// 3. Set up the agent conversation with available tools
const conversation = await runAgentConversationWithTools(
  [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant that can fetch and process user data.' },
    { role: 'user', content: 'Get me information about user ABC123' }
  ],
  // Convert schemas to tool definitions
  Object.entries(functionSchemas).map(([name, parameters]) => ({
    type: 'function',
    function: { name, description: `Function to ${name}`, parameters }
  })),
  toolImplementations
);
```

### Practical Architecture Considerations

- **Stateless vs. Stateful Agents**: When to maintain conversation context
- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Processing**: Designing for response time requirements
- **Local vs. Remote Tool Execution**: Security and performance tradeoffs
- **Rate Limiting and Fallback Strategies**: Handling API constraints
- **Observability and Debugging**: Monitoring agent behavior in production
